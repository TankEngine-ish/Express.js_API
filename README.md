The slight difference between the time it takes on our log and the postman is that 
it takes more time for the response to make it back all the way to postman.

Most express apps use the MVC design pattern. In simplified terms:

The controller processes the user's request and then manipulates the model accordingly.
For example: adding or removing data from a database.

The model is a representation of how the Express app sees the data.
It can translate the data as it lives in storage to how the data is actually used by the application.

The view is how the data from the model is being presented back to the user.

MVC is meant to simplify our code and make it easier to read, update and improve.
